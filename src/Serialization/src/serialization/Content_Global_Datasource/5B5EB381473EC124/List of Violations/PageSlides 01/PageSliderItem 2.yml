        <p>Inventory availability by booking class can vary by Origin and Destination (O&amp;D) cities requested. Gulf Air require connecting flight segments to be booked from a single availability display from point of origin to point of destination. Flight segments sold together are defined as &lsquo;married segments&rsquo; and must not be separated. Rebooking or cancellation of any married segments must at the same time be applied to the connecting flight segment. Booking an additional segment to get extended access to availability, regardless of point-of-sale, origin and destination</p>
        <h4><strong>The following are considered as violations of married segments:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no married segment indicator in the PNR</li>
            <li>The married segment indicator is not in sequence.</li>
            <li>The married segment indicator is missing for one segment of the O&amp;D. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Married segments procedure:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Booked married segment from the O&amp;D availability display.</li>
            <li>When rebooking, cancel all connecting flight segments of a married origin and destination.</li>
            <li>Rebook all new selected flight segments of a married origin and destination in the same entry.</li>
            <li>The practice to un-marry or divorce flight segments to circumvent married segment controls is strictly prohibited</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The ticketing agent will be responsible if tickets are issue which violates Gulf Air&rsquo;s booking policy. Bookings can originate from non-IATA agents and be ticketed by IATA agents.</p>
