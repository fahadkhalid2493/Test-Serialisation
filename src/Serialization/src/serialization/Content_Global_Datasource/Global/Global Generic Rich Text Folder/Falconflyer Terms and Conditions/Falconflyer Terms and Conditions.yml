        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>4. Membership Card</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">A digital copy of the membership card is available online, the member can present the digital card on phone or print it in advance by logging online to the membership account.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="margin: 0in;">5. Membership Grade and Loyalty Points</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The levels of membership - Blue, Silver, Gold and Black&nbsp;- determine increasing degrees of travelling Privileges and other benefits. The current Privileges are described on the website. These will be added to and/or amended over time. Normal entry to the Programme is at the Blue level. Promotion of Members from Blue to Silver,&nbsp;Silver to Gold and from Gold to Black is on the achievement of specified thresholds of Loyalty Points.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Loyalty Points will be awarded only for the Member's travel on Gulf Air flights, ticketed with the relevant carrier's flight number. Every flight, at any fare (with the exception of travel industry discounted fares and redemption tickets T &amp; P classes), is credited with Loyalty Points. Travel in Falcon Gold earns a successively higher credit. The Gulf Air network has been divided into zones for the award of Loyalty Points and the number of Points awarded by class of travel and by zone is detailed in the Guide.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The number of Loyalty Points required for promotion to Silver, Gold and Black membership are given on the website.&nbsp;12 months&nbsp;for Silver and Gold and 24 months for Black&nbsp;beginning from the issue of the first Membership Card.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Loyalty Points have a validity of 12 months for Blue &amp; Silver membership&nbsp;and 24 months for Gold &amp; Black membership from the first flight date, after which they expire and can no longer be counted in the cumulative total.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>6. Membership Grade Promotion and Demotion</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>As soon as a Member's Account shows a cumulative Loyalty Point total equal to or over the number required for Silver, Gold&nbsp;or Black membership (earned during the previous 12 months or less&nbsp;for Silver &amp; Gold and&nbsp;24 months for Black ), the Member will immediately be promoted to the relevant level and a new Card will be issued. New Silver membership status is then valid for one year,&nbsp;Gold and Black&nbsp;membership status is valid for two years.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Prior to the expiry date for all Cards, the cumulative Loyalty Points earned will be compared with the level required to maintain membership at the same level. If sufficient Loyalty Points have been earned at the time of renewal over the previous 12 months for Silver and 24 months for Gold and Black, the Member's Card will be renewed at the same level.&nbsp; Silver membership will be valid for 12 months,&nbsp;Black and Gold membership&nbsp;will be valid for&nbsp;24 months from the date of renewal.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>If the required level of Loyalty Points has not been maintained, the Member's Card will be renewed at the relevant (lower) level. If no Loyalty Points have been earned over the previous 12 months for Silver,&nbsp;24 months for Gold and Black, Gulf Air reserves the right not to renew the Member's Card.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>7. Mileage Awards</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mileage awards can be earned on Gulf Air flights at eligible fare levels only. Published Falcon Gold, full Economy and Economy Excursion fares qualify for Mileage awards. Certain "promotional" or "discounted" fares earn a reduced Award, whilst most other (discounted) fares, including bulk or other unpublished fares or travel industry discounted fares and redemption tickets are not eligible for Mileage awards at all.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The specific class codes which are eligible for Mileage awards and the number of miles awarded by flight, by tier and by class code are detailed&nbsp; on the website.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>8. Crediting Loyalty Points and Miles</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The crediting of due Loyalty Points and Miles to a Member's Account relies upon an automated activity tracking system. Recognition of a Member's qualifying activity is driven by the data capture of the Membership number in association with that activity. Failure by the Member to declare his Membership of the Programme and his Membership number at the prescribed stages in booking and undertaking any activity will result in no automatic award of Loyalty Points and/or Miles. It is then the Member's responsibility to make a retroactive claim for credit (see Section 9) which, if eligible, would then be credited to his Account.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The Member should ensure that he or whoever is making an eligible booking on his behalf is aware of the Membership number and Member name as it appears on the Card and makes it known to Gulf Air at the time of booking. Traveller privileges cannot be provided if the Member has not advised his Membership number and level.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The Member should also produce his Membership digital Card at check in to confirm data capture of his activity, even if his Membership number was already given at reservation stage.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>9. Retroactive Claims for Credits</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If the record of a Gulf Air qualifying flight does not appear on the online&nbsp;membership account&nbsp;after the flight date, or, in the view of the Member, it appears incorrectly, then the Member should complete the retroactive claim form which is available on the member's area of the website. Members should retain the original boarding pass(es) and a legible copy of the passenger ticket and keep it in case they are requested to send it to the Programme offices in Bahrain. If the recording error involves a partner activity, the Member should follow the instructions given for that partner on the website, including the provision of appropriate invoiced activity record documents. File copies should be retained for the Member's own reference.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>All claims for retroactive credit must be made within six months of the flight or partner activity in question. No claims for retroactive credit more than six months after the activity will be accepted.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Retroactive claims for flights taken 90 days prior to the date in which the individual applied for membership will be eligible for credit.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Family members once enrolled into the programme can only earn miles for GF flights taken from the enrolment date. Retroactive claims are not eligible for flights taken prior enrolment date in which the family members applied for membership.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Retroactive claims will not be accepted without the detailed evidence required in 9.1.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Members are strongly requested to undertake their own correct recording and recognition of activity by retaining all boarding passes, passenger coupons from tickets or e-tickets and partner transaction documents in order to settle any account discrepancies and retroactive claims.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>10. Account Statement</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Member Account will be updated on the website every 24 hours provided there are activities to be reported. Copies of the Statement are always available on the website for the Member to review.&nbsp;Inactive Members' Statements will be suppressed until activity recommences.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>11. Miles Redemption</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The member may issue redemption ticket for himself or any family members under his family list without a maximum limit during the whole year.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Redemption ticket is issued against miles deducted from the main member's account.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Redemption tickets can be issued and booked on operated Gulf Air flights as well as any of Gulf Air Airline Partners.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Miles deducted depend on the destination &amp; cabin of service requested.<br />
            (Please refer to mileage calculator option in member portal to know the number of miles required for each sector)
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>All redemptions tickets are subject to availability. The number of redemption seats on each flight is limited. Members should book their redemption tickets as early as possible to maximise the chance of securing the Member's first choice.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Gulf Air may from time to time impose a blackout period in which no redemption tickets will be available.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Gulf Air may withdraw, replace or substitute any redemption ticket at any time without notice.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Miles required for Children redemption tickets are the same as required for adult ticket.

            </li>
            <li>Once the redemption ticket is issued, the passenger&rsquo;s name on the ticket may not be changed and the ticket may not be used by anyone else.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>redemption tickets are not eligible for accrual of miles or loyalty points.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Booking of redemption tickets must be confirmed at time of issuance.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Taxes and additional expenses (such as Airport fees, surcharges&hellip;etc.) should be paid by the member and are non-refundable.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>redemptions tickets are valid for 12 months from the date of issue, unless otherwise stated and cannot be extended or left open.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Redemption tickets must be used in order. Itineraries cannot be abandoned or used in reverse order.

        <h2>4. Membership Card</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">A digital copy of the membership card is available online, the member can present the digital card on phone or print it in advance by logging online to the membership account.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="margin: 0in;">5. Membership Grade and Loyalty Points</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The levels of membership - Blue, Silver, Gold and Black&nbsp;- determine increasing degrees of travelling Privileges and other benefits. The current Privileges are described on the website. These will be added to and/or amended over time. Normal entry to the Programme is at the Blue level. Promotion of Members from Blue to Silver,&nbsp;Silver to Gold and from Gold to Black is on the achievement of specified thresholds of Loyalty Points.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Loyalty Points will be awarded only for the Member's travel on Gulf Air flights, ticketed with the relevant carrier's flight number. Every flight, at any fare (with the exception of travel industry discounted fares and redemption tickets T &amp; P classes), is credited with Loyalty Points. Travel in Falcon Gold earns a successively higher credit. The Gulf Air network has been divided into zones for the award of Loyalty Points and the number of Points awarded by class of travel and by zone is detailed in the Guide.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The number of Loyalty Points required for promotion to Silver, Gold and Black membership are given on the website.&nbsp;12 months&nbsp;for Silver and Gold and 24 months for Black&nbsp;beginning from the issue of the first Membership Card.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Loyalty Points have a validity of 12 months for Blue &amp; Silver membership&nbsp;and 24 months for Gold &amp; Black membership from the first flight date, after which they expire and can no longer be counted in the cumulative total.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>6. Membership Grade Promotion and Demotion</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>As soon as a Member's Account shows a cumulative Loyalty Point total equal to or over the number required for Silver, Gold&nbsp;or Black membership (earned during the previous 12 months or less&nbsp;for Silver &amp; Gold and&nbsp;24 months for Black ), the Member will immediately be promoted to the relevant level and a new Card will be issued. New Silver membership status is then valid for one year,&nbsp;Gold and Black&nbsp;membership status is valid for two years.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Prior to the expiry date for all Cards, the cumulative Loyalty Points earned will be compared with the level required to maintain membership at the same level. If sufficient Loyalty Points have been earned at the time of renewal over the previous 12 months for Silver and 24 months for Gold and Black, the Member's Card will be renewed at the same level.&nbsp; Silver membership will be valid for 12 months,&nbsp;Black and Gold membership&nbsp;will be valid for&nbsp;24 months from the date of renewal.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>If the required level of Loyalty Points has not been maintained, the Member's Card will be renewed at the relevant (lower) level. If no Loyalty Points have been earned over the previous 12 months for Silver,&nbsp;24 months for Gold and Black, Gulf Air reserves the right not to renew the Member's Card.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>7. Mileage Awards</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mileage awards can be earned on Gulf Air flights at eligible fare levels only. Published Falcon Gold, full Economy and Economy Excursion fares qualify for Mileage awards. Certain "promotional" or "discounted" fares earn a reduced Award, whilst most other (discounted) fares, including bulk or other unpublished fares or travel industry discounted fares and redemption tickets are not eligible for Mileage awards at all.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The specific class codes which are eligible for Mileage awards and the number of miles awarded by flight, by tier and by class code are detailed&nbsp; on the website.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>8. Crediting Loyalty Points and Miles</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The crediting of due Loyalty Points and Miles to a Member's Account relies upon an automated activity tracking system. Recognition of a Member's qualifying activity is driven by the data capture of the Membership number in association with that activity. Failure by the Member to declare his Membership of the Programme and his Membership number at the prescribed stages in booking and undertaking any activity will result in no automatic award of Loyalty Points and/or Miles. It is then the Member's responsibility to make a retroactive claim for credit (see Section 9) which, if eligible, would then be credited to his Account.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The Member should ensure that he or whoever is making an eligible booking on his behalf is aware of the Membership number and Member name as it appears on the Card and makes it known to Gulf Air at the time of booking. Traveller privileges cannot be provided if the Member has not advised his Membership number and level.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The Member should also produce his Membership digital Card at check in to confirm data capture of his activity, even if his Membership number was already given at reservation stage.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>9. Retroactive Claims for Credits</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If the record of a Gulf Air qualifying flight does not appear on the online&nbsp;membership account&nbsp;after the flight date, or, in the view of the Member, it appears incorrectly, then the Member should complete the retroactive claim form which is available on the member's area of the website. Members should retain the original boarding pass(es) and a legible copy of the passenger ticket and keep it in case they are requested to send it to the Programme offices in Bahrain. If the recording error involves a partner activity, the Member should follow the instructions given for that partner on the website, including the provision of appropriate invoiced activity record documents. File copies should be retained for the Member's own reference.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>All claims for retroactive credit must be made within six months of the flight or partner activity in question. No claims for retroactive credit more than six months after the activity will be accepted.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Retroactive claims for flights taken 90 days prior to the date in which the individual applied for membership will be eligible for credit.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Family members once enrolled into the programme can only earn miles for GF flights taken from the enrolment date. Retroactive claims are not eligible for flights taken prior enrolment date in which the family members applied for membership.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Retroactive claims will not be accepted without the detailed evidence required in 9.1.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Members are strongly requested to undertake their own correct recording and recognition of activity by retaining all boarding passes, passenger coupons from tickets or e-tickets and partner transaction documents in order to settle any account discrepancies and retroactive claims.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>10. Account Statement</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Member Account will be updated on the website every 24 hours provided there are activities to be reported. Copies of the Statement are always available on the website for the Member to review.&nbsp;Inactive Members' Statements will be suppressed until activity recommences.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>As soon as a Member's Account shows a cumulative Loyalty Point total equal to or over the number required for Silver, Gold&nbsp;or Black membership (earned during the previous 12 months or less&nbsp;for Silver &amp; Gold and&nbsp;24 months for Black ), the Member will immediately be promoted to the relevant level and a new Card will be issued. New Silver membership status is then valid for one year,&nbsp;Gold and Black&nbsp;membership status is valid for two years.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Prior to the expiry date for all Cards, the cumulative Loyalty Points earned will be compared with the level required to maintain membership at the same level. If sufficient Loyalty Points have been earned at the time of renewal over the previous 12 months for Silver and 24 months for Gold and Black, the Member's Card will be renewed at the same level.&nbsp; Silver membership will be valid for 12 months,&nbsp;Black and Gold membership&nbsp;will be valid for&nbsp;24 months from the date of renewal.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>If the required level of Loyalty Points has not been maintained, the Member's Card will be renewed at the relevant (lower) level. If no Loyalty Points have been earned over the previous 12 months for Silver,&nbsp;24 months for Gold and Black, Gulf Air reserves the right not to renew the Member's Card.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>7. Mileage Awards</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mileage awards can be earned on Gulf Air flights at eligible fare levels only. Published Falcon Gold, full Economy and Economy Excursion fares qualify for Mileage awards. Certain "promotional" or "discounted" fares earn a reduced Award, whilst most other (discounted) fares, including bulk or other unpublished fares or travel industry discounted fares and redemption tickets are not eligible for Mileage awards at all.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The specific class codes which are eligible for Mileage awards and the number of miles awarded by flight, by tier and by class code are detailed&nbsp; on the website.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>8. Crediting Loyalty Points and Miles</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The crediting of due Loyalty Points and Miles to a Member's Account relies upon an automated activity tracking system. Recognition of a Member's qualifying activity is driven by the data capture of the Membership number in association with that activity. Failure by the Member to declare his Membership of the Programme and his Membership number at the prescribed stages in booking and undertaking any activity will result in no automatic award of Loyalty Points and/or Miles. It is then the Member's responsibility to make a retroactive claim for credit (see Section 9) which, if eligible, would then be credited to his Account.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The Member should ensure that he or whoever is making an eligible booking on his behalf is aware of the Membership number and Member name as it appears on the Card and makes it known to Gulf Air at the time of booking. Traveller privileges cannot be provided if the Member has not advised his Membership number and level.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The Member should also produce his Membership digital Card at check in to confirm data capture of his activity, even if his Membership number was already given at reservation stage.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>9. Retroactive Claims for Credits</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If the record of a Gulf Air qualifying flight does not appear on the online&nbsp;membership account&nbsp;after the flight date, or, in the view of the Member, it appears incorrectly, then the Member should complete the retroactive claim form which is available on the member's area of the website. Members should retain the original boarding pass(es) and a legible copy of the passenger ticket and keep it in case they are requested to send it to the Programme offices in Bahrain. If the recording error involves a partner activity, the Member should follow the instructions given for that partner on the website, including the provision of appropriate invoiced activity record documents. File copies should be retained for the Member's own reference.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>All claims for retroactive credit must be made within six months of the flight or partner activity in question. No claims for retroactive credit more than six months after the activity will be accepted.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Retroactive claims for flights taken 90 days prior to the date in which the individual applied for membership will be eligible for credit.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Family members once enrolled into the programme can only earn miles for GF flights taken from the enrolment date. Retroactive claims are not eligible for flights taken prior enrolment date in which the family members applied for membership.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Retroactive claims will not be accepted without the detailed evidence required in 9.1.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Members are strongly requested to undertake their own correct recording and recognition of activity by retaining all boarding passes, passenger coupons from tickets or e-tickets and partner transaction documents in order to settle any account discrepancies and retroactive claims.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>10. Account Statement</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Member Account will be updated on the website every 24 hours provided there are activities to be reported. Copies of the Statement are always available on the website for the Member to review.&nbsp;Inactive Members' Statements will be suppressed until activity recommences.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>4. Membership Card</h2>

        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 style="margin: 0in;">5. Membership Grade and Loyalty Points</h2>
        <p style="margin: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The levels of membership - Blue, Silver, Gold and Black&nbsp;- determine increasing degrees of travelling Privileges and other benefits. The current Privileges are described on the website. These will be added to and/or amended over time. Normal entry to the Programme is at the Blue level. Promotion of Members from Blue to Silver,&nbsp;Silver to Gold and from Gold to Black is on the achievement of specified thresholds of Loyalty Points.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Loyalty Points will be awarded only for the Member's travel on Gulf Air flights, ticketed with the relevant carrier's flight number. Every flight, at any fare (with the exception of travel industry discounted fares and redemption tickets T &amp; P classes), is credited with Loyalty Points. Travel in Falcon Gold earns a successively higher credit. The Gulf Air network has been divided into zones for the award of Loyalty Points and the number of Points awarded by class of travel and by zone is detailed in the Guide.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The number of Loyalty Points required for promotion to Silver, Gold and Black membership are given on the website.&nbsp;12 months&nbsp;for Silver and Gold and 24 months for Black&nbsp;beginning from the issue of the first Membership Card.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Loyalty Points have a validity of 12 months for Blue &amp; Silver membership&nbsp;and 24 months for Gold &amp; Black membership from the first flight date, after which they expire and can no longer be counted in the cumulative total.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>6. Membership Grade Promotion and Demotion</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>As soon as a Member's Account shows a cumulative Loyalty Point total equal to or over the number required for Silver, Gold&nbsp;or Black membership (earned during the previous 12 months or less&nbsp;for Silver &amp; Gold and&nbsp;24 months for Black ), the Member will immediately be promoted to the relevant level and a new Card will be issued. New Silver membership status is then valid for one year,&nbsp;Gold and Black&nbsp;membership status is valid for two years.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Prior to the expiry date for all Cards, the cumulative Loyalty Points earned will be compared with the level required to maintain membership at the same level. If sufficient Loyalty Points have been earned at the time of renewal over the previous 12 months for Silver and 24 months for Gold and Black, the Member's Card will be renewed at the same level.&nbsp; Silver membership will be valid for 12 months,&nbsp;Black and Gold membership&nbsp;will be valid for&nbsp;24 months from the date of renewal.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>If the required level of Loyalty Points has not been maintained, the Member's Card will be renewed at the relevant (lower) level. If no Loyalty Points have been earned over the previous 12 months for Silver,&nbsp;24 months for Gold and Black, Gulf Air reserves the right not to renew the Member's Card.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>7. Mileage Awards</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mileage awards can be earned on Gulf Air flights at eligible fare levels only. Published Falcon Gold, full Economy and Economy Excursion fares qualify for Mileage awards. Certain "promotional" or "discounted" fares earn a reduced Award, whilst most other (discounted) fares, including bulk or other unpublished fares or travel industry discounted fares and redemption tickets are not eligible for Mileage awards at all.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The specific class codes which are eligible for Mileage awards and the number of miles awarded by flight, by tier and by class code are detailed&nbsp; on the website.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>8. Crediting Loyalty Points and Miles</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The crediting of due Loyalty Points and Miles to a Member's Account relies upon an automated activity tracking system. Recognition of a Member's qualifying activity is driven by the data capture of the Membership number in association with that activity. Failure by the Member to declare his Membership of the Programme and his Membership number at the prescribed stages in booking and undertaking any activity will result in no automatic award of Loyalty Points and/or Miles. It is then the Member's responsibility to make a retroactive claim for credit (see Section 9) which, if eligible, would then be credited to his Account.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The Member should ensure that he or whoever is making an eligible booking on his behalf is aware of the Membership number and Member name as it appears on the Card and makes it known to Gulf Air at the time of booking. Traveller privileges cannot be provided if the Member has not advised his Membership number and level.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>The Member should also produce his Membership digital Card at check in to confirm data capture of his activity, even if his Membership number was already given at reservation stage.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>9. Retroactive Claims for Credits</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If the record of a Gulf Air qualifying flight does not appear on the online&nbsp;membership account&nbsp;after the flight date, or, in the view of the Member, it appears incorrectly, then the Member should complete the retroactive claim form which is available on the member's area of the website. Members should retain the original boarding pass(es) and a legible copy of the passenger ticket and keep it in case they are requested to send it to the Programme offices in Bahrain. If the recording error involves a partner activity, the Member should follow the instructions given for that partner on the website, including the provision of appropriate invoiced activity record documents. File copies should be retained for the Member's own reference.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>All claims for retroactive credit must be made within six months of the flight or partner activity in question. No claims for retroactive credit more than six months after the activity will be accepted.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Retroactive claims for flights taken 90 days prior to the date in which the individual applied for membership will be eligible for credit.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Family members once enrolled into the programme can only earn miles for GF flights taken from the enrolment date. Retroactive claims are not eligible for flights taken prior enrolment date in which the family members applied for membership.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Retroactive claims will not be accepted without the detailed evidence required in 9.1.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Members are strongly requested to undertake their own correct recording and recognition of activity by retaining all boarding passes, passenger coupons from tickets or e-tickets and partner transaction documents in order to settle any account discrepancies and retroactive claims.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>10. Account Statement</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Member Account will be updated on the website every 24 hours provided there are activities to be reported. Copies of the Statement are always available on the website for the Member to review.&nbsp;Inactive Members' Statements will be suppressed until activity recommences.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>11. Miles Redemption</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The member may issue redemption ticket for himself or any family members under his family list without a maximum limit during the whole year.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Redemption ticket is issued against miles deducted from the main member's account.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Redemption tickets can be issued and booked on operated Gulf Air flights as well as any of Gulf Air Airline Partners.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Miles deducted depend on the destination &amp; cabin of service requested.<br />
            (Please refer to mileage calculator option in member portal to know the number of miles required for each sector)
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>All redemptions tickets are subject to availability. The number of redemption seats on each flight is limited. Members should book their redemption tickets as early as possible to maximise the chance of securing the Member's first choice.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Gulf Air may from time to time impose a blackout period in which no redemption tickets will be available.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Gulf Air may withdraw, replace or substitute any redemption ticket at any time without notice.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>Miles required for Children redemption tickets are the same as required for adult ticket.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
