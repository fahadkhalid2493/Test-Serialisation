Gulf Air is entitled to rely upon such representations. </p>
        <p><strong>If you fail to provide Personal Data </strong><br />
        Where we need to collect Personal Data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you.

        <h2>6 HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA </h2>
        <p>We will only use your Personal Data as permitted by law. Most commonly, we will rely on the following types of lawful basis to process your Personal Data: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> the interests of Gulf Air in conducting and managing our business in order to give you the highest standard of service and the best and most secure travel experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Data for our legitimate interests. For example we may collect data on the confirmation of your passage through various checkpoints at the airport, in order to optimize punctuality. Airport management entities may record the time of the pre-screening of boarding passes before passengers&rsquo; entry to the security area and provide us with this data at the departure gate shortly before departure to enable us to check for missing or possibly delayed passengers and initiate an early unloading of baggage where appropriate. We do not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms (unless we have your express consent or are otherwise required or permitted to do so by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us </li>
            <li><strong>Performance of Contract:</strong> processing your Personal Data is necessary for the performance of the contract of carriage to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract. </li>
            <li><strong>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation:</strong> processing your Personal Data may be necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation to which we are subject. For example, in accordance with Article L 232-6 of French Internal Security Code, we may transmit reservation, checking or boarding data collected from passengers (API/PNR) to the French national public services and competent authorities for the purposes and under conditions as defined in the Decret N&deg; 2014-1095 dated 26 September 2014. </li>
            <li><strong>Protecting your vital interests:</strong> processing your Personal Data is necessary for protecting your vital interests. </li>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> in certain circumstances, we may ask for your express consent to collect, process or transfer your Personal Data, for example in relation to opting into receiving our newsletter or other direct marketing. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time simply by contacting us. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Purposes for which we will use your Personal Data </strong><br />
        We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we will use your Personal Data, and which types of legal basis we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate. <br />
        We may process your Personal Data for more than one lawful basis depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific lawful basis we are relying upon to process your Personal Data where more than one basis has been set out in the table below.</p>

        This website makes use of cookies to measure site activity and to customise information to your personal tastes. A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser which may then store the cookie on your hard drive, either temporarily or long term. This means that, when you visit this website in future, we can tailor information to suit your individual preferences which can save you time and provide you with a more personalised visit. <br />
        You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our Cookie Policy. </p>
        <p><strong>Change of purpose </strong><br />
        We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. <br />
        If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you to explain the legal basis which allows us to do so or, where required by law, to seek your consent. </p>
        <h2>7 MARKETING </h2>
        <p>We aim to provide you with choices regarding certain Personal Data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. <br />
        <strong>Promotional offers from us </strong><br />
        We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this &ldquo;marketing&rdquo;). <br />
        <strong>The &ldquo;soft opt-in&rdquo; </strong><br />
        You will continue to receive marketing communications from us if you have previously booked flights or purchased other services from in the past, or if you have requested information from us in connection with a potential booking or purchase, unless you have opted out of receiving future marketing communications. <br />
        <strong>Third-party marketing </strong><br />
        We will request your express consent before we share your Personal Data with any company outside the Group for marketing purposes. <br />
        <strong>Opting out </strong><br />
        You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time. <br />
        Please note that we may process your Personal Data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law. </p>
        <h2>8 DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA </h2>
        <p>We may have to share your Personal Data for the purposes set out in the table in the &ldquo;HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA&rdquo; section with third party service providers. <br />
        <strong>Disclosure of your Personal Data within Gulf Air </strong><br />
        All parts of Gulf Air, including outstations, branches and offices acting as joint controllers or processors and which are based in EEA and non-EEA countries, e.g. the Kingdom of Bahrain, and provide IT and system administration services. </p>
        <p><strong>Disclosure of your Personal Data to External Third Parties </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Service providers acting as processors based in the Kingdom of Bahrain and all countries to which Gulf Air provides airline services who provide IT and system administration services to Gulf Air. </li>
            <li>Service providers and suppliers acting as processors based in the Kingdom of Bahrain and all countries to which Gulf Air provides airline services who provide passenger services, such as ground-handling companies, catering providers, and companies providing assistance for passengers with reduced mobility. </li>
            <li>Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, consultants, auditors and insurers based in the Kingdom of Bahrain and all countries to which Gulf Air provides airline services who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services. </li>
            <li>Regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the Kingdom of Bahrain and all countries to which Gulf Air provides airline services who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances. </li>
            <li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your Personal Data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your Personal Data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Personal Data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your Personal Data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
        <h2>9 INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS </h2>
        <p><strong>Internal Transfers <br />
        </strong>We will share your Personal Data within the Group. As Gulf Air&rsquo;s head office is based in Bahrain, it may be necessary to transfer Personal Data which was collected in Bahrain outside of it to other parts of the Gulf Air Group. If you are accessing this site from outside Bahrain, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your data in Bahrain or other countries.<br />
        We ensure your Personal Data is protected by requiring all of our Group companies, branches, offices and outstations to follow the same rules when processing your Personal Data. These rules are called "Binding Corporate Rules". Gulf Air&rsquo;s Binding Corporate Rules are found under the Transparency section.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>External Transfers <br />
        </strong>Many of our external third parties are based outside Bahrain so their processing of your Personal Data will involve a transfer of data outside Bahrain.&nbsp;<br />
        Whenever we transfer your Personal Data to third parties which are based outside Bahrain, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to the data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Certain non-EEA countries to which we will transfer your Personal Data have already been deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of protection. For further details, see <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" target="_blank">European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of Personal Data in non-EU countries</a>. </li>
            <li>Where we use third party service providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are covered by the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to Personal Data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en" target="_blank">European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield</a>. </li>
            <li>Where we use certain third party service providers which are not based in the EEA or the US, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give your Personal Data the same protection it has in Europe. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Data out of the EEA.</p>
        <h2>10 DATA SECURITY </h2>
        <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your Personal Data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. <br />
        We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. </p>
        <h2>11 DATA RETENTION </h2>
        <p><strong>How long we retain your Personal Data</strong> <br />
        We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. <br />
        To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. <br />
        In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure in the "YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS" section for further information. In some circumstances we may anonymise your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you and you can no longer be identified by it) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
        <h2>12 YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
            <li>Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete, inaccurate or outdated data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Request blocking or erasure of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to block or delete or remove Personal Data where the Personal Data is incorrect, incomplete, outdated, there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Object to processing of your Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms, if the processing for a particular purpose or in such a manner is to your or a third party data subject&rsquo;s material or moral damage, and is not justified, unless you have provided your consent to such processing. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes (and you will always be able to opt-out via the &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; link on an email from us) and to decisions based solely on automated processing of personal data. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Request the transfer of your Personal Data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies to information which was originally collected electronically and which you either consented to us using or was used to perform a contract with you.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>No fee usually required&nbsp;</strong><br />
        You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data or to exercise any of the other rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information) if we consider your request to be unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, in these circumstances, we may refuse to comply with your request but we will provide you with a full explanation of this at the time.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What we may need from you&nbsp;</strong><br />
        We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Time limit to respond&nbsp;</strong><br />
        We will respond to all legitimate access requests within fifteen business days and to all other legitimate requests for correction, blocking, and wiping, within ten business days. If your request is particularly complex, or you have made a number of requests, or there are justifiable reasons, it may take us up to 3 calendar months to respond, but we will notify you of this and keep you updated.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Users in the European Economic Area (&ldquo;EEA&rdquo;) and United Kingdom (&ldquo;UK&rdquo;)</strong> <br />
        If you are located in the EEA or UK, you have the right to request access to your data in a portable format and to request the rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, or objection to processing of your personal data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the UK GDPR. You also have the right to obtain a free copy of the specific contracts referenced in Section 9. You may use the information in Section 3 to submit your request. Additionally, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your Supervisory Authority if you are located in the EEA, and with the ICO if you are located in the UK. <br />
        We will respond to all legitimate requests within one calendar month. If your request is particularly complex, or you have made a number of requests, or there are justifiable reasons, it may take us up to 3 calendar months to respond (instead of the 1 calendar month mentioned earlier), but we will notify you of this and keep you updated. <br />
        Personal data is also processed outside of the UK, Switzerland, and the EEA by Gulf Air&rsquo;s group companies, or our service providers, including to process transactions, facilitate payments, and provide support services as described in Section 8. We use specific standard clauses to facilitate transfers of personal data from the EEA to third countries and have entered into data processing agreements with our service providers and Gulf Air Group companies to restrict and regulate their processing of your data. By submitting your data, accessing our site or using our services, you consent to this transfer, storage, and processing by Gulf Air and its processors.&nbsp;</p>
