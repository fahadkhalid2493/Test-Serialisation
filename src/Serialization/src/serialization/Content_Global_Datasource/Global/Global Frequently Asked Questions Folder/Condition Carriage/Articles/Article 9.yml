        <h4>9.1 SCHEDULES</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>The flight times shown in timetables may change between the date of publication and the date you actually travel. We do not guarantee them to you and they do not form part of your contract with us. </li>
            <li>Before we accept your booking, we will notify you of the scheduled flight time in effect as of that time, and it will be shown on your Ticket. It is possible we may need to change the scheduled flight time subsequent to issuance of your Ticket. If you provide us with contact information, we will endeavour to notify you of any such changes. If, after you purchase your Ticket, we make a significant change to the scheduled flight time, which is not acceptable to you, and we are unable to book you on an alternate flight which is acceptable to you, you will be entitled to a refund in accordance with Article 10.2. </li>

        <h4>9.2 CANCELLATION, REROUTING, DELAYS, ETC</h4>
        <p><strong>9.2.1</strong> We will take all necessary measures to avoid delay in carrying you and your Baggage.

        <strong>9.2.2.1</strong> carry you at the earliest opportunity on another of our scheduled services on which space is available without additional charge and, where necessary, extend the validity of your Ticket; or <br />
        <strong>9.2.2.2</strong> within a reasonable period of time re-route you to the destination shown on your Ticket by our own services or those of another carrier, or by other mutually agreed means and class of transportation without additional charge. If the fare and charges for the revised routing are lower than what you have paid, we shall refund the difference; or <br />
        <strong>9.2.2.3</strong> make a refund in accordance with the provisions of Article 10.2. <br />
        <strong>9.2.3</strong> Upon the occurrence of any of the matters set out in Article 9.2.2, except as otherwise provided by the Convention, or applicable local law, including in particular EC Regulation 261/2004 on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, the options outlined in Article 9.2.2.1 to 9.2.2.3 are the sole and exclusive remedies available to you and we shall have no further liability to you. <br />
        <strong>9.2.4</strong> If we are unable to provide previously confirmed space, we shall provide compensation to those Passengers denied boarding in accordance with applicable law and our denied boarding compensation policy.
