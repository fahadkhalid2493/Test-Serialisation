        <h4>1. GENERAL</h4>
        <p>Except as provided in Articles 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5, our Conditions of Carriage apply to all flights, or flight segments, in respect of which we have a legal liability to you. </p>
        <h4>2. CHARTER OPERATIONS</h4>
        <p>If carriage is performed pursuant to a charter agreement, these Conditions of Carriage apply only to the extent they are incorporated, by reference or otherwise, in the charter agreement or the Ticket. </p>
        <h4>3. CODESHARES</h4>
        <p>On some services we may have arrangements with other carriers known as "Codeshares". This means that even if you have a reservation with us and hold a ticket where our name or airline designator code is indicated as the carrier, another carrier may operate the aircraft. If such arrangements apply we will advise you of the carrier operating the aircraft at the time you make a reservation and the conditions of contract and/or conditions of carriage of the carrier operating the aircraft may apply in place of these Conditions of Carriage. </p>
        <h4>4. OVERRIDING LAW</h4>
        <p>These Conditions of Carriage are applicable unless they are inconsistent with our Tariffs or applicable law in which event such Tariffs or laws shall prevail.
        If any provision of these Conditions of Carriage is invalid under any applicable law, the other provisions shall nevertheless remain valid. </p>
        <h4>5. CONDITIONS PREVAIL OVER REGULATIONS</h4>
        <p>Except as provided in these Conditions of Carriage, in the event of inconsistency between these Conditions of Carriage and any other regulations we may have including any Conditions of Contract dealing with particular subjects, these Conditions of Carriage shall prevail. </p>
        <h4>6. ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEXT PREVAILS</h4>
        <p>These Conditions of Carriage are reproduced in several languages. If there is any inconsistency between the English text and a non-English text, the English text will apply unless applicable local law requires otherwise. The English language text can be viewed on our website. </p>
