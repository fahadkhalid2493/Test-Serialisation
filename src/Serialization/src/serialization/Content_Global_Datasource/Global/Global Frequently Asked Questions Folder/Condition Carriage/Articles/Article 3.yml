        <h4>GENERAL PROVISIONS</h4>
        <p><strong>1. </strong>We will provide carriage only to the Passenger named in the Ticket, and you may be required to produce appropriate identification. <br />
        <strong>2.</strong> A Ticket is not transferable. <br />
        <strong>3.</strong> Some Tickets are sold at discounted fares which may be partially or completely non-refundable. You should choose the fare best suited to your needs. You may also wish to ensure that you have appropriate insurance to cover instances where you have to cancel your Ticket. <br />
        <strong>4.</strong> If you have a Ticket, as described in 3.1.3 above, which is completely unused, and you are prevented from travelling due to Force Majeure, provided that you promptly advise us and furnish evidence of such Force Majeure, we will provide you with a credit of the non-refundable amount of the fare, for future travel on us, subject to deduction of a reasonable administration fee. That credit will be valid for use by you for purchase of a Ticket for yourself or another person within 12 months after the credit is issued. <br />
        <strong>5.</strong> The Ticket is and remains at all times the property of the issuing carrier. <br />
        <strong>6.</strong> Except in the case of an Electronic Ticket, you shall not be entitled to be carried on a flight unless you present a valid Ticket containing the Flight Coupon for that flight and all other unused Flight Coupons and the Passenger Coupon. In addition, you shall not be entitled to be carried if the Ticket presented is mutilated or if it has been altered otherwise than by us or our Authorised Agent. In the case of an Electronic Ticket, you shall not be entitled to be carried on a flight unless you provide positive identification and a valid Electronic Ticket has been duly issued in your name and delivered to you. <br />
        <strong>7. (a)</strong> In case of loss or mutilation of a Ticket (or part of it) by you or non-presentation of a Ticket containing the Passenger Coupon and all unused Flight Coupons, upon your request we will replace such Ticket (or part of it) by issuing a new Ticket, provided there is evidence, readily ascertainable at the time, that a Ticket valid for the flight(s) in question was duly issued and you sign an agreement to reimburse us for any costs and losses, up to the value of the original ticket, which are necessarily and reasonably incurred by us or another carrier for misuse of the Ticket. We will not claim reimbursement from you for any such losses which result from our own negligence. The issuing carrier may charge a reasonable administration fee for this service, unless the loss or mutilation was due to the negligence of the issuing carrier, or its agent. <br />
        <strong>(b)</strong> Where such evidence is not available or you do not sign such an agreement, the carrier issuing the new Ticket may require you to pay up to the full Ticket price for a replacement Ticket, subject to refund if and when the original issuing carrier is satisfied that the lost or mutilated Ticket has not been used before the expiry of its validity. If, upon finding the original Ticket before the expiry of its validity, you surrender it to the carrier issuing the new Ticket, the foregoing refund will be processed at that time. <br />
        <strong>3.1.8 </strong> A ticket is valuable and you should take appropriate measures to safeguard it and ensure it is not lost or stolen. </p>
        <h4>3.2 PERIOD OF VALIDITY</h4>
        <p><strong>3.2.1</strong> Except as otherwise provided in the Ticket, these Conditions, or in applicable Tariffs (which may limit the validity of a ticket, in which case the limitation will be shown on the Ticket) a Ticket is valid for: <br />
        <strong>A.</strong> one year from the date of issue; or <br />
        <strong>B.</strong> subject to the first travel occurring within one year from the date of issue, one year from the date of first travel under the Ticket. <br />
        <strong>3.2.2</strong> When you are prevented from travelling within the period of validity of the Ticket because at the time you request reservations we are unable to confirm a reservation, the validity of such Ticket will be extended until we are able to confirm a reservation, or you may be entitled to a refund in accordance with Article 10. <br />
        <strong>3.2.3</strong> If after having commenced your journey, you are prevented from travelling within the period of validity of the Ticket by reason of illness, we may extend the period of validity of your Ticket until the date when you become fit to travel or until our first flight after such date, from the point where the journey is resumed on which space is available in the class of service for which the fare has been paid. Such illness must be attested to by a medical certificate. When the flight coupons remaining in the Ticket, or in the case of an Electronic Ticket, the electronic coupon, involve one or more Transit Points, the validity of such Ticket may be extended for not more than three months from the date shown on such certificate. In such circumstances, we will similarly extend the period of validity of Tickets of other members of your immediate family accompanying you. <br />
        <strong>3.2.4</strong> In the event of death of a Passenger in the course of a contract of carriage, the Tickets of persons accompanying the Passenger may be modified by waiving the minimum stay or extending the validity. In the event of a death in the immediate family of a Passenger who has commenced travel, the validity of the Passenger's Tickets and those of his or her immediate family who are accompanying the Passenger may likewise be modified. Any such modification shall be made upon receipt of a valid death certificate and any such extension of validity shall not be for a period longer than forty-five (45) Days from the date of the death. </p>
        <h4>3.3 COUPON SEQUENCE AND USE</h4>
        <p><strong>3.3.1</strong> The Ticket you have purchased is valid only for the transportation as shown on the Ticket, from the place of departure via any Agreed Stopping Places to the final destination. The fare you have paid is based upon our Tariff and is for the transportation as shown on the Ticket. It forms an essential part of our contract with you. <br />
        <strong>3.3.2</strong> Your ticket is no longer valid if the Coupons are not used in the sequence provided in the Ticket, for example if you commence your journey at any Transit Point or agreed stopping place. Should you wish to change any aspect of your transportation you must contact us in advance. The fare for your new transportation will be calculated and you will be given the option of accepting the new price or maintaining your original transportation as ticketed. Should you be required to change any aspect of your transportation due to Force Majeure, you must contact us as soon as practicable and we will use reasonable efforts to transport you to your next Transit Point or final destination, without recalculation of the fare. <br />
        <strong>3.3.3</strong> Should you change your transportation without our agreement, we will assess the correct price for your actual travel. You will have to pay any difference between the price you have paid and the total price applicable for your revised transportation. We will refund you the difference if the new price is lower but otherwise, your unused Coupons have no value. Failure to pay the price applicable to your revised transportation will result in refusal of carriage. <br />
        <strong>3.3.4</strong> Please be aware that while some types of changes will not result in a change of fare, others, such as changing the place of departure (for example, if you do not fly the first segment) or reversing the direction you travel, can result in an increase in price. Many fares are valid only on the dates and for the flights shown on the Ticket and may not be changed at all, or only upon payment of an additional fee. <br />
        <strong>3.3.5</strong> Each Flight Coupon contained in your Ticket will be accepted for carriage in the class of service on the date and flight for which space has been reserved. When a Ticket is originally issued without a reservation being specified, space may be later reserved subject to our Tariff and the availability of space on the flight requested. <br />
        <strong>3.3.6</strong> Please be advised that in the event you do not show up for any flight, your subsequent flight reservations will not be valid and we will not carry you until we have calculated the revised fare for your actual transportation and you have paid the difference between the fare you have already paid and the revised fare which applies to your changed transportation. If the revised fare is lower than the fare you have already paid, we will refund you the difference, less any applicable administration fee(s). </p>
        <h4>3.4 NAME AND ADDRESS OF CARRIER</h4>
        <p>Our name may be abbreviated to our Airline Designator Code, or otherwise, in the Ticket. Our address is P O Box 138, Kingdom of Bahrain. </p>
