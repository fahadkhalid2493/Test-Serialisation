        <p><strong>6.1</strong> Check-in Deadlines are different at every airport and we recommend that you make yourself aware about these Check-in Deadlines and honour them. Your journey will be smoother if you allow yourself ample time to comply with the Check-in Deadlines. We reserve the right to cancel your reservation if you do not comply with the Check-in Deadlines indicated. We or our Authorised Agents will advise you of the Check-in Deadline for your first flight on us. For any subsequent flights in your journey, you should inform yourself of the Check-in Deadlines. Check-in Deadlines for our flights may be obtained from us or our Authorised Agents. If no time is indicated, Check-in Deadline is 1 hour before the published departure time. </p>
        <p><strong>6.2</strong> You must be present at the boarding gate not later than the time specified by us when you check in. This time will normally be specified on your boarding pass but may be changed by public announcement or otherwise. </p>
        <p><strong>6.3</strong> We may cancel the space reserved for you if you fail to arrive at the boarding gate in time. </p>
        <p><strong>6.4</strong> We will not be liable to you for any loss or expense incurred due to your failure to comply with the provisions of this Article. </p>
