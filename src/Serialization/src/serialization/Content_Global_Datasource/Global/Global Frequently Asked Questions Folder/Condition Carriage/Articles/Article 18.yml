                <li>To provide you with a range of personalised services. The type of personal information we collect about you depends on how you use the website; and</li>
                <li>Records of any emails or other correspondence that you send via the website. </li>
                <li>For identification and verification purposes. </li>
                <li>For our own reference and record. </li>

In particular, we use a third-party service provider, DealBroker, to send you details of hotel, restaurants and other offers that might interest you by email or text message. We will only pass on your personal information to DealBroker if you have consented to this. In this respect, the Partner will be bound by the privacy Terms &amp; Conditions. Please note that these third-party service providers will send you emails and/or text messages on Gulf Air's behalf. These third-party service providers will also use your personal information that we provide them with to enter into contracts with you for the provision of goods and services which you may from time to time wish to purchase. <br />
                Your data may be used for the following purposes: accounting, billing and audit, credit or other payment card verification, immigration and customs control, security, administrative and legal purposes, operation of the Gulf Air Falconflyer programme, to present offers from Gulf Air Holidays, to contact you in response to applications for a career with Gulf Air and to operate the Gulf Air Cargo systems, systems testing, maintenance and development, customer relations and to help us in any future dealings with you, for example by identifying your requirements and preferences. For these purposes we may disclose your data to any of the following: airlines and other companies involved in providing your travel or related services and facilities (including DealBroker), data processing companies working on our behalf, travel agents, government and enforcement agencies and credit and charge card companies. However, Gulf Air is not liable for any third party's action in this regard. <br />
                You will occasionally receive emails about fare sales, special offers, new services and other noteworthy news items. We hope you will find these updates interesting and informative. <br />
                Other than the above, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent unless disclosure is either necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, authorised or required by law, reasonably necessary to enforce the law or necessary to investigate a suspected unlawful activity. <br />
                Your personal data, including your sensitive personal data, will only be kept insofar as necessary for the reasons set out in this privacy policy, and for so long as necessary to comply with EU law and/or national laws within the EU. </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Sensitive information</h4>
            <p>In addition to the type of information that you may provide us identified above, you may also provide us, or third parties that we work with, with sensitive personal data.<br />
            This includes information about your race or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or other similar beliefs; trade union membership; physical or mental health (for example, whether you have any allergies); sexual life; and any offences (or alleged offences) that you have committed or any proceedings relating to any such offences. <br />
            To the extent that you have not otherwise made such sensitive information public, we will use such data for the purposes you have consented to, as well as to protect your or another person's vital interests. This will include the purposes set out above. We may also disclose your sensitive data if this is necessary for preventing fraud.<br />
            We will disclose your sensitive information to those persons we have identified at Section 3 above, only insofar as this is necessary. </p>
            <h4>Marketing and Promotions</h4>
            <p>Whenever we ask you for information about yourself you may, by ticking the relevant box, opt in to receive these marketing communications from us and we will not disclose your information to any third party for marketing purposes after you opt out. In addition, whenever you are contacted by email or SMS you will be told how to opt out to enable you to stop receiving such alerts in the future should you change your mind. <br />
            Please note that we, or our Business Partners will only send email or SMS promotions or announcements to you if you have previously given your permission for us to do so. <br />
            If you purchase any goods or services that are being offered on our behalf, you will be entering into a contract directly with our third-party service provider, and not with Gulf Air or any of our Group companies.<br />
            Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites. </p>
            <h4>Security</h4>
            <p>Gulf Air will take appropriate steps to protect the personal information you share with us. We have implemented technology and security features to safeguard the privacy of your personal information. A secure server protects your personal information. <br />
            How we secure your payment information when you book online</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you buy a Gulf Air ticket over the World Wide Web your web browser connects with the web site through SSL ("Secure Sockets Layer"). SSL is an industry-standard protocol for encryption over the Internet. </li>
                <li>When information is encrypted, it is scrambled between your computer and our server. The information is only unscrambled when it safely reaches our end. It's fast and safe, and it ensures that your personal information cannot be read by anyone else. As with any standard email, emails containing your personal data sent to or from Gulf Air will travel in a non-encrypted format. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Accessing schedules, fares and making a booking.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When checking schedules and fares, no personal information is being exchanged, and so encryption is not used.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you have made a reservation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As you make a reservation, we need to capture your personal details to go into the booking. At this point the information is encrypted. You can tell this is happening as browsers will display a key or padlock at the bottom left corner.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition, if you become aware of any security breach, please let us know as soon as possible.<br />
            Please do not share any of your personal information, such as passwords or personal identification numbers, with anyone. If necessary, please log out of our website when you have finished using it. Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information.<br />
            Gulf Air cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by third-party accesses to information as a result of your failure to keep your personal information private.</p>
            <h4>Cookies</h4>
            <p>A cookie is a small string of information that a website transfers to your browser for identification purposes. The cookies we pass to you are anonymous and do not hold information on you or reveal your personal identity.<br />
            However, if you nevertheless prefer not to receive cookies, you can configure your Internet browser to reject them. Rejecting cookies can however limit the functionality of our website and our online services to you.</p>
            <h4>Updating personal information</h4>
            <p>You can at any time choose to change your personal details, and we request that you keep your information as current as possible so that we may continue to improve our service to you.<br />

                <h4>Transfer of information overseas</h4>

Please let us know if you have any objections to such transfers.  Where we are required to do so by law or at the request of a regulator, we will obtain your prior consent to any transfer of your personal information outside the European Economic Area.</p>
