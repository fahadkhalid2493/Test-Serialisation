If there is no space on the flight we will use reasonable efforts to transport you to your next or final destination. <br />
        <strong>5.5.2</strong> You should check the reconfirmation requirements of any other Carriers involved in your journey with them. Where it is required, you must reconfirm with the Carrier whose code appears for the flight in question on the Ticket.</p>
