        <h4>11.1 GENERAL</h4>
        <p>If, in our reasonable opinion, you conduct yourself aboard the aircraft so as to endanger the aircraft or any person or property on board, or obstruct the crew in the performance of their duties, or fail to comply with any instructions of the crew including but not limited to those with respect to smoking, alcohol or drug consumption, or behave in a manner which causes discomfort, inconvenience, damage or injury to other passengers or the crew, we may take such measures as we deem reasonably necessary to prevent continuation of such conduct, including restraint. You may be disembarked and refused onward carriage at any point, and may be prosecuted for offences committed on board the aircraft. </p>
        <h4>11.2 PAYMENT OF DIVERSION COSTS</h4>
        <p>If, as a result of conduct by you of the sort mentioned in Article 11.1, we decide, in the exercise of our reasonable discretion, to divert the aircraft for the purpose of offloading you and / or your Baggage, you must pay all costs resulting from that diversion. </p>
        <h4>11.3 ELECTRONIC DEVICES</h4>
        <p>For safety reasons, we may forbid or limit operation aboard the aircraft of electronic equipment, including, but not limited to, cellular telephones, laptop computers, portable recorders, portable radios, CD, DVD and MP3 players, electronic games or transmitting devices, including radio-controlled toys and walkie-talkies. Operation of hearing aids and heart pacemakers is permitted. </p>
        <h4>11.4 ON BOARD ALCOHOL</h4>
        <p>You are not allowed to consume alcohol aboard an aircraft (whether purchased as duty free from us or someone else or otherwise obtained) unless it has been served to you by us. We have the right, at any time and for any reason, to refuse to serve you alcohol or to withdraw alcohol which has been served to you.</p>
