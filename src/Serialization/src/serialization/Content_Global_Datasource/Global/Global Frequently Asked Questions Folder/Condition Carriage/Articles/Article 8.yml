        <strong>8.3.1.3</strong> items which are considered by us in our sole discretion to be unsuitable for carriage because they are dangerous or unsafe, or because of their weight, size, shape or character, or because they are fragile or perishable having regard to, among other things, the type of aircraft being used. Information about unacceptable items is available upon request. <br />
        <strong>8.3.2 </strong>Firearms and ammunition other than for hunting and sporting purposes are prohibited from carriage as Baggage.

You must not take any item into the aircraft cabin which you are forbidden from taking into the aircraft cabin by law. <br />

        <p><strong>8.4.1</strong> Subject to paragraphs 8.3.2 and 8.3.6, we will refuse to carry as Baggage the items described in 8.3, and we may refuse further carriage of any such items upon discovery. <br />
        <strong>8.4.2</strong> We may refuse to carry as Baggage any item reasonably considered by us to be unsuitable for carriage because of its size, shape, weight, content, character, or for safety or operational reasons, or the comfort of other passengers.

If you are not available, your Baggage may be searched in your absence for the purpose of determining whether you are in possession of or whether your Baggage contains any item described in 8.3.1, 8.3.4, 8.3.5 or any firearms, ammunition or weapons, which have not been presented to us in accordance with 8.3.2. If you are unwilling to comply with such request we may refuse to carry you and your Baggage. In the event a search or scan causes Damage to you, or an x-ray or scan causes damage to your Baggage, we shall not be liable for such Damage unless due to our fault or negligence. </p>
        <h4>8.6 CHECKED BAGGAGE</h4>
        <p><strong>8.6.1</strong> Upon delivery to us of your Baggage which you wish to check, we will take custody of, and issue a Baggage Identification Tag for, each piece of your Checked Baggage. <br />
        <strong>8.6.2</strong> Checked Baggage must have your name or other personal identification affixed to it. <br />
        <strong>8.6.3</strong> Checked Baggage will, whenever possible, be carried on the same aircraft as you, unless we decide for safety, security or operational reasons to carry it on an alternative flight. If your Checked Baggage is carried on a subsequent flight we will deliver it to you, unless applicable law requires you to be present for customs clearance or the reason for carriage on a subsequent flight is that the Checked Baggage is in excess of your free Baggage Allowance or it does not comply with relevant parts of these Conditions of Carriage. <br />
        <strong>8.6.4</strong> If you have Baggage in excess of your free Baggage Allowance, we will endeavour to carry it subject to payment by you of the applicable extra charge. We will endeavour to carry your excess Checked Baggage on the same flight as you if there is suitable space available on the aircraft but, if we decide for safety, security or operational reasons to carry your excess Checked Baggage on a subsequent flight, we will notify you. In these circumstances, you must make your own arrangements to collect your excess Checked Baggage from the airport at the point of destination and we will not be responsible for delivering it to you. <br />
        <strong>8.6.5</strong> We do not permit you to carry Baggage that is not your own or that of another Passenger. </p>
        <h4>8.7 UNCHECKED BAGGAGE</h4>
        <p><strong>8.7.1</strong> We may specify maximum dimensions and / or weight for Unchecked Baggage which you carry on to the aircraft. If we have not done so, Baggage which you carry onto the aircraft must fit under the seat in front of you or in an enclosed storage compartment in the cabin of the aircraft. If your Baggage cannot be stored in this manner, or is of excessive weight, or is considered unsafe for any reason, it must be carried as Checked Baggage. <br />
        <strong>8.7.2</strong> Objects not suitable for carriage in the cargo compartment (such as delicate musical instruments), and which do not meet the requirements in 8.7.1 above, will only be accepted for carriage in the cabin of the aircraft if you have given us notice in advance and permission has been granted by us. You may be required to pay a separate charge for this service. </p>
        <h4>8.8 COLLECTION AND DELIVERY OF CHECKED BAGGAGE</h4>
        <p><strong>8.8.1</strong> Subject to Article 8.6.3, you are required to collect your Checked Baggage as soon as it is made available at your destination or Transit Point. Should you not collect it within a reasonable time, we may charge you a storage fee. Should your Checked Baggage not be claimed within three (3) months of the time it is made available, we may dispose of it without any liability to you. <br />
        <strong>8.8.2</strong> Only the bearer of the Baggage Check and Baggage Identification Tag is entitled to delivery of the Checked Baggage. We accept no responsibility for checking the identity or authority of the bearer of the Baggage Check and Baggage Identification Tag or for checking that such person has any right to collection.<br />
        <strong>8.8.3</strong> If a person claiming Checked Baggage is unable to produce the Baggage Check and identify the Baggage by means of a Baggage Identification Tag, we will deliver the Baggage to such person only on condition that he or she establishes to our satisfaction his or her right to the Baggage. </p>
        <h4>8.9 ANIMALS</h4>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our absolute discretion, to refuse to carry any animals (which, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, shall include birds). If we agree to carry any animals they will be carried subject to the following conditions: <br />
        <strong>8.9.1</strong> You must ensure that the animal is properly crated with necessary supplies of food and water or carried in a container complying with any applicable legal requirements and accompanied by valid health and vaccination certificates, entry permits, and other documents required by countries of entry or transit failing which, it will not be accepted for carriage. Such carriage may be subject to additional conditions specified by us, which are available on request. <br />
        <strong>8.9.2</strong> If accepted as Baggage, the animal, together with its container and food, shall not be included in your free Baggage allowance, but shall constitute excess baggage, for which you will be obliged to pay the applicable rate. <br />
        <strong>8.9.3</strong> Live animals (including birds but with the exception of falcons on selected routes) are prohibited from carriage as Checked Baggage. Falcons may be carried in the cabin or as Checked Baggage on selected routes subject to regulations in the destination country and our rules for the carriage of falcons (available on request) provided that we are notified no less than 48 hours prior to departure. The excess baggage charges referred to in Article 8.9.2 will apply. <br />
        <strong>8.9.4</strong> Guide dogs accompanying Passengers with disabilities will be carried free of charge in addition to the normal free baggage allowance, subject to conditions specified by us, which are available on request. <br />
        <strong>8.9.5</strong> Where carriage is not subject to the liability rules of the Convention, we are not responsible for injury to or loss, sickness or death of an animal which we have agreed to carry unless we have been negligent. <br />
        <strong>8.9.6 </strong>We will have no liability in respect of any such animal not having all the necessary exit, entry, health and other documents with respect to the animal's entry into or passage through any country, state or territory and the person carrying the animal must reimburse us for any fines, costs, losses or liabilities reasonably imposed or incurred by us as a result. </p>
        <h4>8.10 ITEMS REMOVED BY AIRPORT SECURITY PERSONNEL</h4>
        <p>We will not be responsible for, or have any liability in respect of, articles removed from your Baggage by airport security personnel. </p>
