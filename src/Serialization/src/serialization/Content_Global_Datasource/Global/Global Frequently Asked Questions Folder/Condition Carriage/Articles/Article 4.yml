        <h4>4.1 FARES</h4>
        <p>Fares apply only for carriage from the airport at the point of origin to the airport at the point of destination, unless otherwise expressly stated. Fares do not include ground transport service between airports and between airports and town terminals. Your fare will be calculated in accordance with our Tariff in effect on the date of payment of your ticket for travel on the specific dates and itinerary shown on it. Should you change your itinerary or dates of travel, this may change the fare to be paid. If after you have purchased your ticket there is a promotion advertising a Fare lower than the Fare your purchased your ticket for, we shall not reimburse you with the difference. </p>
        <h4>4.2 TAXES, FEES AND CHARGES</h4>
        <p>Applicable taxes, fees and charges imposed by government or other authority, or by the operator of an airport, shall be payable by you. At the time you purchase your Ticket, you will be advised of taxes, fees and charges not included in the fare, most of which will normally be shown separately on the Ticket. The taxes, fees and charges imposed on air travel are constantly changing and can be imposed after the date of Ticket issuance. If there is an increase in a tax, fee or charge shown on the Ticket, you will be obliged to pay it. Likewise, if a new tax, fee or charge is imposed even after Ticket issuance, you will be obliged to pay it. Similarly, in the event any taxes, fees or charges which you have paid to us at the time of Ticket issuance are abolished or reduced such that they no longer apply to you, or a lesser amount is due, you will be entitled to claim a refund. <br />
        <strong>4.2.1</strong> If you are a resident of, and your flight departs from, the Federal Republic of Germany, any increase in taxes, fees or charges will not be applied in the period of 4 months from the date of purchase of the ticket.<br />
        <strong>4.2.2</strong> If you do not use your Ticket, you will be entitled to a refund of any taxes, fees and charges which you paid, less a reasonable service charge.</p>
        <h4>4.3 CURRENCY</h4>
        <p>Fares, taxes, fees and charges are payable in the currency of the country in which the Ticket is issued, unless another currency is indicated by us or our Authorised Agent at or before the time payment is made (for example, because of the non-convertibility of the local currency). We may at our discretion, accept payment in another currency.</p>
