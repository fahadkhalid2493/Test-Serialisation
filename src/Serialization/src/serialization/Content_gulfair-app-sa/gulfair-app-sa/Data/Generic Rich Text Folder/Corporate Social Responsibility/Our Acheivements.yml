        <h3>Our Acheivements</h3>
        <p>Since the launch of its CSR policy in September 2008, Gulf Air has made some notable achievements on several fronts and it is ongoing. The list below is not exhaustive but indicates the national carrier's genuine and sincere efforts towards achieving its CSR goals.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with General Directorate for the Protection of the Environment and Wildlife (GDEWP) to cooperate on environmental and educational programmes.</li>
            <li>Introduction of a series of initiatives designed to result in an annual reduction of around 33,000 tons of CO2 emissions from its aircraft.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These include :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flying a more direct route to certain destinations, which has so far resulted in the reduction of around 22,600 tons of Co2 emissions per year.</li>
            <li>Combining its two in-flight magazines, Gulf Life and On Air into one magazine. The new look Gulf Life magazine is being produced using a slightly lower weight of paper to reduce the overall weight carried on board.</li>
            <li>Reduction in the number of spare in-flight magazines carried on board and instead making provision for storage and replenishment on ground at its Bahrain hub and outstations. The combined benefit of these measures should result in the reduction of approximately 600 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.</li>
            <li>Reduction in the amount of potable water carried on board its flights by 25%, which will save around 1800 tons of carbon emissions each year.</li>
            <li>Other fuel conservation measures include reduced contingency fuel, acceleration height management and a flight spare kit weight reduction that will together save approximately 8,300 tons of CO2 emissions, all of which is intended to improve efficiency while maintaining the highest levels of flight safety and schedule reliability.</li>
            <li>Selecting CFM56-5B, one of the most fuel-efficient engines, to power its new A320 Airbus fleet seven of which have already joined the fleet that will reduce emissions by 200 tons per aircraft per year.</li>
            <li>The recent introduction of 'Falcon Gold" premium class combining the best of its First and Business Class that is expected to reduce CO2<br />
            emissions by a significant quantity due to reduction in the weight of catering equipment/accessories carried onboard and other measures. </li>
            <li>Development of a system for measuring in-flight waste.</li>
            <li>Implementation of a system for recycling in-flight waste (aluminum cans, paper and plastic water bottles)</li>
            <li>Implementation of a system for recycling paper, plastics and glass in GF headquarter buildings.</li>
            <li>Completion of a waste management survey on hanger, maintenance bays and workshops.</li>
            <li>Signing of a pledge on sustainable aviation fuel along with a group of airlines, aircraft manufactures, research institutions and NGO's.</li>
            <li>Sponsoring local and regional events on environment protection.</li>
            <li>Establishment of a fuel conservation committee to reduce carbon emissions.</li>
            <li>Completion of preparation for European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) by monitoring and recording our carbon emissions.</li>
            <li>Working with recycling organizations on recycling and waste management for ground and in-flight waste.</li>
            <li>Signing of agreement with IATA to introduce voluntary cabon programme to its customers.</li>
        </ul>
