        <p>This website makes use of cookies to measure site activity and to customise information to your personal tastes. A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser which may then store the cookie on your hard drive, either temporarily or long term. This means that, when you visit this website in future, we can tailor information to suit your individual preferences which can save you time and provide you with a more personalised visit (because the cookie extracts this information about you).&nbsp; For example:<br />
        <br />
        Our cookies will remember your chosen language and country so that when you go to the website the pages are in that language and the departure airports are in that country.<br />
        <br />
        If you are halfway through a booking, our cookies will allow you to browse other areas of the website and then return back to your booking.<br />

        <br />
        <strong>Analytical/performance cookies</strong>.<br />
        These allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors use our website when they are visiting it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Functionality cookies.</strong><br />
        These are used to recognise you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your country of residence, your language, the last trip you booked or the reservations associated with your Falconflyer account).&nbsp; Disabling these cookies will prevent certain pages of the gulfair.com website from displaying correctly (for example, your Falconflyer account), limit the level of online help GF can offer and block us from storing preferences needed to display or disable certain features.<br />

        <strong>Marketing cookies</strong>.<br />
        These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed.
