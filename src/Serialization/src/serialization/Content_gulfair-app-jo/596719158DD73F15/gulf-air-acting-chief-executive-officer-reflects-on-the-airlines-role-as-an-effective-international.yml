        <p>Gulf Air Acting Chief Executive Officer Captain Waleed AlAlawi reflected on the airline&rsquo;s achievements during a number of interviews and media opportunities conducted with him by several local and international media publications.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Captain AlAlawi stated &ldquo;We are pleased to have the Gulf Air services and products recognized by so many renowned aviation related entities; while maintaining our status as an effective and conscience international citizen. We are constantly striving to deliver excellence to our passengers by enhancing a broad spectrum of deliverables from our convenient flight schedules, numerous international and regional flights, and a variety of products and services both on the ground and onboard. Winning these awards is a reflection of Gulf Air&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to fulfil the ever-changing travel needs of our passengers; placing us truly in &lsquo;a class of our own&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During the pandemic, and being one of the few airlines in the world that never stopped flying; Gulf Air repatriated many citizens and non-citizens who were affected by the close down, and helped take them back home. Also, the airline shipped food and medical supplies into Bahrain, using its Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner cabin seats for cargo. Moreover, The American Government officially thanked Gulf Air for repatriating US citizens out of Afghanistan, as a token of appreciation for the national carrier&rsquo;s humanitarian gesture.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gulf Air received the Skytrax Five Star COVID-19 Airline Safety Rating after a vigorous audit by Skytrax Research that took place between November and December 2021. The rating came as a direct result to the success of airline&rsquo;s operations in flying safely throughout the pandemic and enhancing its airport and onboard protocols to combat the spread of COVID-19. The airline received this recognition by providing the highest standards to customers and staff whilst maintaining its boutique strategy to deliver its renowned Arabian hospitality.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gulf Air also received, for the second consecutive year, APEX&rsquo;s Five Star Major Official Airline Rating. Based solely on certified passengers&rsquo; feedback, the rating came as proof of the success of Gulf Air&rsquo;s boutique strategy and the major developments in its products and services since the launch of the recent brand refresh and fleet modernization programme.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Captain AlAlawi added &ldquo;I am so proud to have the opportunity to work with such a dedicated team represented by the national carrier&rsquo;s workforce, to help turn around Gulf Air and make it the customer-centric airline it has become today. The immense team effort paid towards realizing this goal has led to the many achievements and accolades we now enjoy at Gulf Air&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>More recently, the national carrier was honoured at Singapore&rsquo;s Changi Airline Awards, winning in the &ldquo;Connectivity Award&rdquo; and the &ldquo;New Airline Award&rdquo;.</p>
