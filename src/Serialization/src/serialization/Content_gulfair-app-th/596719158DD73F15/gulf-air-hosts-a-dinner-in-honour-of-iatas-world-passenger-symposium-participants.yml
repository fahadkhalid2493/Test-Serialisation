        <p>Gulf Air &ndash; the national carrier of the Kingdom of Bahrain, and the World&rsquo;s Most Improved Airline 2022 &ndash; hosted a dinner in honour of the Kingdom's guests who participated in the World Passenger Symposium, which was recently held by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) at the Gulf Hotel in Bahrain&rsquo;s capital, Manama. The dinner was attended by the Chief Executive Officer of Gulf Air Captain Waleed Al Alawi, Director General of IATA Mr. Willie Walsh, and a number of dignitaries that included CEOs, members of the Gulf Air Board of Directors, and members of the airline&rsquo;s Executive Management.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Captain Al Alawi welcomed the guests of the national carrier and the symposium&rsquo;s participants, hoping they benefit from the discussions raised within the topics of the Symposium, and that they enjoy the hospitality the Kingdom of Bahrain is renowned for. For his part, Mr. Walsh thanked Gulf Air for hosting the Symposium and its gala dinner, highlighting the strong relationship between IATA and Gulf Air as one of the oldest and most prestigious carriers in the Association and in the region.</p>
        <p>The dinner guests enjoyed learning about some of the local traditional crafts that included the art of weaving, the art of making baskets, and the art of Arabic calligraphy. The attendees also enjoyed the melodies of Arabic music through live oud playing, and the melodies of Western music through a live band that played all-time famous jazz songs.</p>
